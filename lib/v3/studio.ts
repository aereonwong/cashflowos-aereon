// growing, and who owes me money. Every figure here comes from his records.

// Two rules hold throughout, and both are load-bearing:
//   · Ringgit only in totals. Foreign-currency invoices are counted and listed
//     separately, never converted and summed into RM.
//   · One shared scale. Both years in the pace chart, and every month frame, are
//     measured against the same maximum, so no comparison is flattered by an
//     axis that quietly rescaled itself.
