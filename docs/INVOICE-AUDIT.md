# Invoice audit · 21 Sep 2026

Every design in the Canva **Invoices** folder has now been read and imported — 2021 through 2026.
Quotations were skipped by instruction. This is what the documents themselves say, and where they
disagree with each other.

## What is in the database now

| Year | Invoices | Ringgit | Foreign |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 2021 | 6 | RM 18,900.00 | |
| 2022 | 21 | RM 61,298.00 | USD 2,800 |
| 2023 | 45 | RM 168,892.25 | USD 3,397.80 · SGD 2,723.40 · EUR 230 |
| 2024 | 27 | RM 67,700.70 | SGD 3,155 · USD 555 |
| 2025 | 41 | RM 113,432.05 | USD 1,977.50 · SGD 1,500 |
| 2026 | 45 | RM 149,734.47 | USD 1,400 · RMB 4,000 |
| **Total** | **185** | **RM 579,957.47** | USD 10,130.30 · SGD 7,378.40 · RMB 4,000 · EUR 230 |

131 clients. All rows are status `issued` — documented, payment not tracked.

Note: 2021 and 2022 are almost certainly incomplete in Canva itself. 2021 starts at invoice #005
and only six documents survive; 2022 has visible gaps (see below).

## Not imported, on purpose

| Document | Why |
|---|---|
| `SYCP-202412-004 - Resorts World Awana Shooting` | An unedited copy of the WOLO invoice — same number `SYCP-202412-003`, same client, same RM 3,500. Importing it would have invented RM 3,500 of income. |
| `20220422 - Oppo X Legoland Quotation` | A quotation, filed in the Invoices folder. |
| `20230201 - SYCP-DO-23-06 Gamuda SplashMania` | A delivery order, not an invoice. |
| `20220221 CANCELLED - XG Coating` (2022-05, RM 5,000) | Marked cancelled. |
| `20210609 - CANCELLED Tajikistan KL Tower` (#011, RM 5,000) | Marked cancelled. |
| `20211105 - CANCELLED Fairfax` (2021-17, RM 1,000) | Marked cancelled. |

## The inconsistencies

### 1. Six numbering schemes in five years
- 2021: `005`, `011`, `012` — a plain running number, no year
- 2021–22: `2021-15`, `2022-02` — year plus sequence
- Late 2022: `SYCP-2022-34` … running **at the same time** as `2022-19`, `2022-21`
- 2023: `SYCP-2023-02` … alongside a parallel `2023-14` … `2023-21` series used only for the
  PersonEdge / Lazada jobs
- Jan 2024: `202401-01`; from Feb 2024 onward: `SYCP-202402-001` — the current scheme
- Two odd ones out: `AW-2024-02-01`, `AW-2026-01-01` (both foreign, both paid by PayPal)

Gaps: no `2023-01`, `-03`, `-14`, `-16`; 2022 jumps `2022-13` → `2022-16`; `SYCP-2022-37`/`-38`
never appear; there is no `SYCP-202503` series at all (no March 2025 invoice).

### 2. Six duplicate invoice numbers
| Number | Used on |
|---|---|
| `2023-19` | 10 Sep 2023, 19 Oct 2023, 19 Oct 2023 — **three times** |
| `2021-16` | 3 Nov 2021, 29 Dec 2021 |
| `2022-02` | 9 Jan 2022, 18 Feb 2022 |
| `SYCP-2023-34` | 15 Nov 2023, 17 Nov 2023 |
| `2023-21` | 16 Nov 2023, 21 Dec 2023 |
| `SYCP-202604-006` | 3 and 10 Apr 2026 |

Two more (`SYCP-202608-001`, `SYCP-202608-002`) were fixed at source in Canva on 21 Sep 2026 and
re-imported — see "Corrections applied" below. The six above are still live in the documents.

### 3. The file name disagrees with the document
- `2023-20 - Lazada September` prints **2023-19** inside
- `SYCP-23-27` in titles vs `SYCP-2023-27` inside — the short form is used in about 30 titles
- `20230705 - SYCP-23-23` is dated **07/07/23** inside
- `20210609 - CANCELLED Tajikistan` is dated **9 July 2021** inside
- `AW-2024-02-01 - Varlens` is dated **01/02/25** — it is a 2025 invoice
- Two titles start with a space (`" SYCP-202508-001"`, `" 20220923 - Lazada 9.90"`)

### 4. Two bank accounts
The personal account (**WONG SENG YUE**, 001-00-89274-7) is on every 2021–2022 invoice and stays on
the PersonEdge / Lazada series right through December 2023. The company account (**SY CREATIVE
PRODUCTION SDN. BHD.**, 395-00-15702-1) is on everything else. In October 2023 both were in use in
the same month. Worth a word with the accountant.

### 5. Personal data printed on invoices
The 2021 invoices print an IC number (`870427-14-5073`); one 2022 invoice prints a home address in
Cheras. Neither belongs on a document sent to a client.

### 6. Six currencies, no exchange rate recorded
MYR, USD, SGD, EUR, RMB — plus a bare `$` that means **ringgit** on the 2021 invoices and **US
dollars** on the September 2023 one. The prefix also changed from `RM` to `MYR` during 2024. No
invoice records the rate used, so foreign income cannot be converted for reporting.

### 7. Discounts live inside the price cell
About twenty invoices write `RM 3,500.00 (DISCOUNT RM500)` in the price column and then put the net
figure in the amount column. One (Peakzone, Feb 2025) does it properly with a negative line. There
is no way to total how much was discounted without reading every document.

### 8. Reimbursements mixed in with fees
HONOR Borneo Tour bills RM 5,000 of fee plus nine separate travel lines; Trip.com Singapore bills
USD 1,600 plus USD 1,147.80 of claims; Visit Singapore adds a SGD 155 bike tour; Klook adds a
RM 1,500 travel allowance. These inflate revenue — they are money passing through, not earnings.

### 9. No standard payment terms
Seen across the folder: 50/50, 30% deposit, 25/75, 40/30/30, 20% deposit, net 30 days, "before
release", "within 5 working days", "within 10 working days", and several invoices with no terms at
all. The Pavilion KL invoice says *"30% Deposit of RM30,000"* on a **RM 9,000** invoice.

### 10. Client identity is loose
- Five invoices are billed to a person, not a company (Bill Gallagher, Chew Le Chen, Lindsey Yap,
  Rick Stickney, Jessica Jenna)
- The same client appeared under two spellings four times — Wavemaker, Trip.com, DM Dasher and
  Serious Media. Those have now been merged, but it was splitting the client totals in half.
- Company registration numbers appear on maybe half the invoices; a named contact on about half
- No SST / tax identification number on any invoice

## What a standard template should fix

1. **One number series, forever**: `SYCP-YYYYMM-NNN`, never reused, never reset, issued in order.
   No parallel series for any client.
2. **File name = invoice number**, nothing else in front of it.
3. Separate fields for **subtotal, discount, reimbursements, total** — discounts as their own
   negative line, never inside a price.
4. **Currency and, for foreign invoices, the rate and its date.**
5. Fixed blocks for **client legal name, registration number, contact person and email**.
6. One **payment terms** dropdown with three or four agreed options, plus a due date.
7. The **company bank account only**, and the company registration number as the only ID printed.
8. A **status** field: Draft / Issued / Cancelled — so cancelled work is never confused with income.
9. Quotations, delivery orders and credit notes get **their own folders and prefixes**
   (`SYCP-Q-`, `SYCP-DO-`, `SYCP-CN-`).


## Corrections applied · 21 Sep 2026

Aereon corrected four invoices in Canva; they were re-read and the database updated to match.

| Was | Now | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| `SYCP-202608-001`, 8 Aug 2026 | `SYCP-202609-001`, 8 Sep 2026 | Wrong month in the number and the date |
| `SYCP-202608-002`, 17 Aug 2026 | `SYCP-202609-002`, 17 Sep 2026 | Wrong month in the number and the date |
| `SYCP-202608-002`, 17 Aug 2026 (StarGather) | `SYCP-202609-003`, 17 Sep 2026 | Wrong month; also clears a three-way number clash |
| Client "SGO Communications" | **G.O. Communications** | Misspelt company name on the three Marvel Wolverine invoices |

Effects: RM 5,000 moved from August 2026 into September 2026 (September is no longer an empty
month); duplicate invoice numbers fell from eight to six; and G.O. Communications — RM 14,500 across
three jobs — now appears under its real name, which matters because it is a top-five client of the
last twelve months.

Totals are unchanged: 185 invoices, RM 579,957.47, 131 clients.
